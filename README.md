**2025-September**: migrated www.yukongis.ca from Wordpress on Dreamhost to static html on Github Pages via Simply Static WP plugin then some DIY scripts, heavily aided by LLM coding agents (mostly Claude Sonnet).

Next step undetermined, maybe setting up Hugo. Or Trilium for authoring and Mkdocs for publishing. Or something.
